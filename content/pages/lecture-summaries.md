Who are some pioneering—and award-winning—STEM women that every historian of science should know? How can we celebrate Marie Curie’s accomplishments while avoiding pitfalls of the “hero effect”? How do awards recognize and validate women in the STEM fields? What problems/inequities exist in the way female scientists and engineers are and have been honored?

Sun Sisters: Field trip to the Harvard Observatory
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


In what key ways have women contributed to the astronomical sciences? How have women in Massachusetts—and Cambridge in particular—played an outsized role in 19th and early 20th century astronomy? What is the "harem effect"? 

Guest speakers:

Lindsay Smith, Curator of the Astronomical Photographic Plate Collection at the [Harvard College Observatory](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hco)

[Dava Sobel](http://www.davasobel.com/), author, who will discuss her book, _[The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/315726/the-glass-universe-by-dava-sobel/9780143111344/)_.

Engineeresses
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
How is the culture of engineering different from that of science? How have women affected the engineering profession and its role in society? Who are some notable women in the development of engineering, and how have their ranks expanded into the many disciplines we see today? How have recent educational trends led to increased visibility of engineering as a profession for women?
